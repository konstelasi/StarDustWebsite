# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI coding agents in this repository. What the site is and how
it's built are in [README.md](README.md). Read its "Conventions" section
before changing a demo.

## This repository

- English pages live under `app/(en)/`, Indonesian under `app/id/`, and UI
  strings in `messages/{en,id}/`.
- `messages/{en,id}/glossary.json` is generated from the separate
  `StarDustGlossary` repo. Edit the content there and rerun its compiler,
  never the generated files.
- Claims about the engine must match the engine. If this site and the
  engine's README disagree, the engine wins.

## Writing style

Every human-read text here, copy and code comments alike, follows StarDust's
writing style guide (`.agent/rules/writing-style-guide.md` in
<https://github.com/damarbob/StarDust>). The core of it:

- Never use an em dash or an en dash, nor a hyphen standing in for one.
  Split the sentence, or use a comma or parentheses. Hyphenated words such as
  "end-to-end" are fine.
- Never put a colon or semicolon in a heading or title.
- Use colons and semicolons sparingly in prose. Prefer two sentences.
- One strong claim with a concrete fact beside it is fine. Two in one line,
  or one in every sentence, reads as generated.
- Aim for about 80% formal and 20% conversational. Vary sentence length, and
  never introduce errors on purpose.

Older text still has dashes. Follow the rule for every sentence you write or
rewrite.

## Indonesian copy

- **StarDust terms stay English**: Field, Entry, Tenant, Page, Slot, Engine,
  Wire format and the rest of the glossary. If a translation sounds odd in
  Indonesian, keep the English. `bidang`, `penyewa`, `halaman`, `mesin` and
  `kawat` were all tried and reverted.
- **Re-compose, don't translate word by word.** Literal idioms and
  prepositions read as calque, for example `kolom kelas satu` for
  "first-class columns" or `di bawah` for "under this clause".
- **Check meaning against the English, not just fluency.** Words with a
  narrow technical sense are where a fluent translation goes wrong. A "free"
  slot is available, not `gratis`. A "tombstoned" column is marked, not
  `dihapus`. A double negative must survive translation.
- If swapping one word doesn't fix an awkward sentence, rewrite the whole
  sentence.

## Commits

- Don't commit unless asked. Hand over the message and a `git add` with
  explicit paths.
- **Never add a `Co-Authored-By` line** or any other attribution trailer. A
  person adds one by hand if they want it.
- Follow StarDust's `.agent/rules/commit-style-guide.md`: an imperative
  subject with no prefix, bullets for several changes, body lines never
  hard-wrapped, and never `#` followed by digits.
