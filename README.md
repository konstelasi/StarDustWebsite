# StarDust — website

Landing page for [StarDust](https://github.com/damarbob/StarDust), a MySQL-native
Vertical Schema Partitioning engine for dynamic data models.

The engine is abstract — most of what makes it interesting happens in background
daemons, over time, in tables nobody sees. So the page is built around four
interactive demonstrations rather than prose:

| Section | What it shows |
| :-- | :-- |
| `components/SlotMirror.tsx` | Edit a payload, flip fields between filterable and JSON-only, and watch values mirror into typed indexed slot columns — then see what a filter on each field actually costs. |
| `components/JoinSwamp.tsx` | An illustrative cost model of EAV join fan-out against StarDust's fixed single-page join, as the number of filter conditions grows. |
| `components/FieldLifecycle.tsx` | The promotion window: `promoteFieldToFilterable()` returns → the Watcher provisions a page → the Reconciler claims the slot and backfills → it flips to `ready`, with a live NDJSON event stream. Mirrors `examples/01-field-lifecycle.php` in the engine repo. |
| `components/DaemonBoard.tsx` | All four daemons running on their own poll periods, coordinating only through shared MySQL state. |

## The playground

`/playground` ([`app/playground/`](app/playground/),
[`components/playground/`](components/playground/)) is a second route: one
continuous world where the schema you define produces the rows you write, which
produce the index the daemons build. Unlike the four sections above, which each
reset on their own and share nothing, every part of it reads the state the
previous part produced — so it needs a persistent world with a clock, which is
what [`lib/sim/`](lib/sim/) is.

It opens **guided** on a first visit: a sixteen-step walk through the whole arc —
define, store, write, index, query, evolve — that dispatches the same actions a
visitor dispatches by hand, one commit per press, and hands the world it built
over to the sandbox at the end. The toggle in the page header switches between
the two at any point; they are two modes over one world, never two routes.
[`lib/sim/tour.ts`](lib/sim/tour.ts) holds the steps and, beside each one's copy,
an assertion for every number and event name that copy says out loud.

**It is a simulation and says so on the page.** There is no Node runtime, no PHP
and no MySQL in production, so it cannot run the real engine. The rules were
written by hand to match; where the two disagree, the engine is right.

Two conventions hold that honesty in place, and both are cheaper to keep than to
restore:

- **Engine semantics live only in `lib/sim/`.** No component encodes a rule about
  slots, statuses or daemons. If a component needs to know whether a filter would
  be rejected, it asks the core.
- **Event names, operators and error codes are closed unions.**
  [`lib/sim/events.ts`](lib/sim/events.ts) mirrors the engine's closed event
  vocabulary and [`lib/sim/filter/ast.ts`](lib/sim/filter/ast.ts) its twelve
  operators and thirteen validation codes, so an invented name in either is a
  `npm run typecheck` failure rather than a plausible-looking string in a log
  panel or a dropdown. Both are checked-in copies — the engine is a separate
  repository and nothing here can verify them — so when the engine adds one,
  add it there in the same change. The mirrors that are *behaviour* rather than
  text can be checked against the engine directly, and two have been. A 75-case
  corpus run through the real `JsonFilterDecoder` agrees with the decoder on
  error code and JSON Pointer for every case, including three where PHP's
  inability to tell `{}` from `[]` decides the answer. A 96-case corpus run
  through the real `RetypeCoercionEngine` agrees with the ADR 0024 matrix in
  `lib/sim/backfill.ts` on outcome and reason for **every** case; the only
  divergences are nine values where JavaScript's single number type cannot
  represent PHP's distinction (`(float) 42` is `42.0` there and `42` here) or
  loses integer precision above 2^53.
- **Reducers are pure.** No `new Date()`, no `Math.random()`, no module-level
  counters: timestamps come from `simNow(world)` and ids from `world.seq`.
  React StrictMode double-invokes reducers, so anything else builds a different
  world in development than in production — and a random seed generator would
  produce rows the event log then describes wrongly.
- **Where the simulation is narrower than the engine, it says so on the page.**
  The datetime parser takes ISO 8601 and `Y-m-d H:i:s`; the engine hands the
  value to PHP's `DateTimeImmutable`, which also accepts `tomorrow` and reads a
  naked string in the *server's* timezone. Reproducing that in a browser would
  mean guessing at a server configuration and rendering the guess as fact, so
  it is a documented subset instead. The one narrowing that is a language
  limit rather than a choice is in the filter decoder's `in` deduplication:
  PHP distinguishes `1` from `1.0` and JavaScript does not, so the engine keeps
  both and the simulation collapses them.
- **Where the simulation is *wider* than the engine — because the engine has a
  bug — it says so at the line that causes it.** There are two, and this is the
  only kind of divergence that needs naming rather than merely documenting,
  because reproducing it faithfully would make a demo teach the defect:
  - The simulation resets `sweep_cursor_id` when a slot is tombstoned and the
    engine does not, so a recycled slot column's second sweep skips every row
    below the first sweep's final cursor
    ([`lib/sim/reserve.ts`](lib/sim/reserve.ts)).
  - The simulation applies a datetime filter bound's UTC offset and the engine
    does not: MySQL parses the offset off an RFC 3339 literal and throws it
    away, so `+07:00` compares as though it were UTC — while the *write* path
    converts properly, which means a value written and then filtered for does
    not match itself ([`lib/sim/search/execute.ts`](lib/sim/search/execute.ts),
    measured against a real MySQL 8.0.13).

  Both comments are what stop the lines being quietly "corrected" back to
  match; when the engine fixes either, delete the comment rather than the line.
- **The schema is quoted, not paraphrased.** [`lib/sim/ddl.ts`](lib/sim/ddl.ts)
  holds each `CREATE TABLE` verbatim from the engine's bootstrap runner, and the
  playground puts it one click from the rows so the "these are the engine's
  columns" claim is checkable. Same duty as `events.ts` and rather less
  forgiving: a stale event name fails a build, a stale `CREATE TABLE` just looks
  right. When the engine's schema changes, change it there in the same commit.

Build sequencing lives in [`PLAYGROUND_ROADMAP.md`](PLAYGROUND_ROADMAP.md).

## Glossary

`/glossary` ([`app/(en)/glossary/`](<app/(en)/glossary/>),
[`components/Glossary.tsx`](components/Glossary.tsx)) lists all 44 StarDust
terms in plain language. [`components/Term.tsx`](components/Term.tsx) marks a
handful of them inline in the landing page's own prose — a dotted underline,
revealed on hover, focus, or tap — each deep-linking to its full entry on the
page.

**The definitions are a manual mirror of the engine's own
[`GLOSSARY.md`](https://github.com/damarbob/StarDust/blob/main/GLOSSARY.md),
not machine-synced.** Unlike [`lib/sim/ddl.ts`](lib/sim/ddl.ts)'s verbatim
quoting of the engine's `CREATE TABLE` statements described above, these are
condensed by hand into one sentence each rather than copied literally — and,
same duty as `ddl.ts`, updated by hand when the source changes.
[`messages/{en,id}/glossary.json`](messages/en/glossary.json) carries one
sentence per term, deliberately shorter than the engine's own glossary entries
(that file is contributor-facing and cites internal detail — ADR numbers,
table and column names — the site must not repeat).
[`scripts/verify-glossary.ts`](scripts/verify-glossary.ts) is what catches
drift automatically: every `<Term id>` used on the landing page must resolve
in both locale catalogs, the two catalogs must carry identical keys, and every
definition must stay a single sentence — run with `npm run verify:glossary`.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run typecheck
npm run build      # static export into out/
```

Requires Node 20+ (CI uses 22).

Don't run `npm run build` while `npm run dev` is up — they share `.next/`, and
the build overwrites the running server's webpack runtime, which turns every
request into a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` 500. Stop the dev server first, or delete
`.next/` and restart it if you already have.

## Build

There is **no Node runtime in production**. `npm run build` produces `out/`, a
self-contained folder of static files that any static host can serve.

```bash
npm ci
npm run build          # → out/
```

Publishing is putting the **contents** of `out/` at the web root.

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) typechecks and builds on
every push and attaches `out/` as a downloadable **`site`** artifact, so a
release never requires building locally. It deliberately does not deploy —
that would mean putting host credentials in repository secrets, which is a
decision to make on purpose rather than inherit from a template.

Three settings exist for the sake of static hosting, and are easy to break by
tidying:

- **`trailingSlash: true`** in [`next.config.mjs`](next.config.mjs) emits each
  route as `<route>/index.html`, which a plain file server resolves through its
  normal index lookup. Turn it off and routes 404 unless the visitor types
  `.html`.
- **No `basePath`** — the site is served from the domain root. Set one only if
  it moves into a subdirectory.
- **[`public/.htaccess`](public/.htaccess)** ships alongside the build, since
  Next copies dotfiles from `public/`. On Apache-family hosts it wires up the
  exported 404 page, forces HTTPS, and caches the content-hashed
  `_next/static/` bundles for a year while holding HTML at `must-revalidate` —
  that pairing is what makes a redeploy take effect immediately rather than
  after a cache expiry. Other hosts ignore the file; configure the equivalent
  there.

`SITE_URL` in [`lib/links.ts`](lib/links.ts) is the canonical origin used for
the canonical link and Open Graph tags. Those must be absolute, and a static
export has no request to derive a host from, so it is stated there and nowhere
else — update that one constant if the domain changes.

## Conventions

- **No CSS framework.** Design tokens live at the top of [`app/globals.css`](app/globals.css);
  everything else is CSS Modules. The colour ramp is load-bearing, not decorative —
  teal means *indexed*, amber means *pending/backfilling*, rose means *rejected or
  tombstoned*, and neutral slate means *JSON-only: stored, and never mirrored by
  design*. Keep that mapping if you add a demo — the last two are the pair most
  easily confused, and colouring a JSON-only value as a failure teaches the
  opposite of what the engine does.
- **No animation library.** Transitions are CSS; the value-in-flight ghosts are the
  Web Animations API over measured DOM rects ([`lib/fly.ts`](lib/fly.ts)).
- **Every demo honours `prefers-reduced-motion`** by jumping to a settled end state
  rather than by animating faster. The end state is the lesson.
- **URLs live in [`lib/links.ts`](lib/links.ts), never in a component.** That
  module has no `'use client'` on purpose: a constant exported from a client
  module arrives at a server component as a client-reference stub, and while a
  bare `href={REPO}` survives it, `` `${REPO}/issues` `` stringifies the stub's
  source code into the href and ships a broken link. This already happened once.
- **Claims about the engine must match the engine.** Event names in the log stream
  come from StarDust's closed ADR 0020 vocabulary, and the numbers in `JoinSwamp`
  are labelled on the page as an illustrative model rather than a benchmark. If a
  claim here and the engine's README ever disagree, the engine wins.
