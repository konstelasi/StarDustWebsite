/**
 * The ADR 0020 closed event vocabulary, mirrored.
 *
 * The engine fails its own build if a scanned source directory emits an event
 * name that is not on its allowlist (`EventVocabularyTest`). This file is that
 * discipline, ported: the names are a `const` tuple, {@link EventName} is the
 * union over it, and every log line the simulation emits is typed. An invented
 * name is therefore a `npm run typecheck` failure rather than a
 * plausible-looking string in a log panel.
 *
 * PROVENANCE — this list is every `'event' => '...'` literal emitted from the
 * engine's `src/` as of 2026-09-17. It is a checked-in *mirror*: the engine is
 * a separate repository, so nothing in this repo can prove it still matches.
 * When the engine adds an event, add it here in the same change.
 *
 * One name that is conspicuously absent, and should stay absent: the schema
 * registry's `SchemaBuilder` logs `'schema model defined'` as a plain PSR-3
 * *message*, not as an `'event' =>` key. Defining a model therefore emits
 * nothing into this vocabulary, and the playground's log panel is correctly
 * empty until a daemon runs.
