/**
 * Bumping this invalidates every snapshot in every returning visitor's
 * browser. Do it whenever a shape below changes incompatibly — a stale
 * snapshot that still parses is worse than one that is discarded.
 *
 * **What does and does not require a bump**, because it is currently
 * discoverable only by reading one spread operator in `persist.ts`, and every
 * later stage faces the question:
 *
 * - A new **top-level** member of `SimWorld` does **not**. The restore is
 *   `{ ...emptyWorld(), ...parsed }`, so an older snapshot that lacks the key
 *   simply keeps the default. Bumping for one of those discards a returning
 *   visitor's schema in exchange for nothing.
 * - A new member of `clock`, `seq`, `draft`, `payloadDraft` or `queryDraft` no
 *   longer does either. Those used to be restored wholesale, so a new member
 *   came back `undefined`; `persist.ts` now merges each onto its
 *   `emptyWorld()` default, and a missing one comes back as that default
 *   instead. A new nested draft joins that list in `persist.ts` — `queryDraft`
 *   did, in the same change that added it.
 * - An incompatible change to an existing shape still **does**. A member whose
 *   meaning or type changed is not repaired by a merge, and that is the case
 *   this constant is now for.
 *
 * And do not add the new member to `persist.ts`'s `isWorldish()` either: that
 * probe is deliberately cheap, and requiring a key every older snapshot lacks
 * reintroduces the discard through the back door.
 *
 * 2 — `SimWorld` gained `draft`, so a v1 snapshot restores without one.
 * 3 — the job, checkpoint and DLQ shapes were aligned to the real tables:
 *     `jobs` split into `importJobs` / `exportJobs`, and `seq` gained members.
 *     `seq` is restored wholesale rather than merged, so a v2 snapshot would
 *     come back with `seq.importJob === undefined` — a persisted broken world,
 *     which is exactly what this constant exists to prevent.
 *     That is the reasoning the nested merge above now retires: from this
 *     version on, a missing member of one of those four comes back as its
 *     default instead of `undefined`, so it is no longer a bump's job to
 *     prevent it.
 * 4 — a page carries exactly the columns it indexes. `SimPage.indexedColumns`
 *     went from naming a *subset* of a fixed sixty to naming the page's whole
 *     column set, and `slots` holds one row per column rather than sixty per
 *     page. Both are changes of *meaning* to members every v3 snapshot already
 *     has, so nothing is missing and no merge repairs them — which is exactly
 *     the case this constant is for. Restoring one produced a world that was
 *     half of each and said so on screen: `stardust_slot_assignments` showing
 *     sixty rows for a page the mirror rendered as one column, over a free
 *     ratio of 1.0000 that counted fifty-nine slots no reservation could take.
 *     A returning visitor would have been looking at the defect this change
 *     removes, in the section whose whole promise is that these are the real
 *     rows.
 * 5 — `DaemonActivity.action` went from a rendered English string to a
 *     translation key plus params, so the locale layer can render it in
 *     whichever language is live (`DaemonCard` is the one reader). A v4
 *     snapshot's `action` is still a string, and rendering it as one would
 *     either crash the key lookup or, worse, print the raw string back —
 *     `t()` returns its own argument unresolved when a key does not resolve,
 *     which for an old English sentence looks like a working translation
 *     that silently stopped translating.
 * 6 — `DaemonActivity.workers` changed element type, from `WorkerClaim`
 *     (Reconciler-shaped: `source`, `firstId`/`lastId`, an optional `note`) to
 *     `WorkerLine` (`{worker, state, detail}`), so the Liberator could write
 *     the same field once it went multi-worker too. Both are top-level-nested
 *     — `workers` lives inside `daemonActivity`, which is restored wholesale
 *     — so a v5 snapshot's array is the old shape and rendering an element of
 *     it as the new one reads `line.detail.key` off an object that has no
 *     `detail`, which is the same silent-then-crashing failure version 5 was
 *     written to prevent for `action`.
 *
 * `payloadDraft` arrived without a bump, as the first application of the rule
 * above: it is top-level, `seq` already carried `entry` and `sync`, and a v3
 * snapshot restores with an empty form and every model it had. It stayed at 3
 * through the merge, too. While section C was still iterating, `payloadDraft`
 * changed shape under a fixed version, and snapshots written mid-iteration
 * restored with `payloadDraft.values === undefined` — which threw during
 * render, unmounting the tree along with the Reset button that would have
 * cleared it. That is a shape-churn hazard no version constant can catch,
 * because the version does not move while a member is still being built; the
 * merge is what fixes it, and it repairs those snapshots in place rather than
 * discarding a returning visitor's schema.
