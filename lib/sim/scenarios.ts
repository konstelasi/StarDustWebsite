/**
 * Scenario presets — parked worlds, earned rather than staged.
 *
 * A sandbox where every control is unlocked is not the same thing as a sandbox
 * where every *behaviour* is reachable. Three of the things the sections are
 * built around cannot be produced by ordinary play: the promotion window needs
 * a backfill spanning more than one 500-row chunk; the reclaim needs a slot that
 * has been promoted, backfilled, demoted and swept before anything asks for it
 * again; `is_null` mid-backfill needs the Reconciler stopped inside a chunk
 * boundary. Each is a stated "done when" for its section, so a visitor who only
 * ever writes three rows by hand gets a playground where the section's own
 * claim never occurs.
 *
 * The second of those used to be a stronger claim — that a *warm* reservation
 * was unreachable at all, because the Watcher indexed only as many columns as
 * there were waiters and a fresh page therefore never had a spare. Index
 * headroom retired that: a page now carries four columns of every family, so
 * three of them are spare the moment it exists and the second promotion of a
 * type is warm without any help. What is still unreachable by ordinary play is
 * the *round trip* — and that is what this scenario now parks in front of.
 *
 * What is missing is not data — the entry writer already seeds 600 rows — but
 * *history*. Every one of those three comes from an ordering, or from a prior
 * lifecycle, rather than from a row count.
 *
 * Hence: a list of the same actions a human dispatches, folded through the same
 * `reduce()`. Never a hand-built `SimWorld`. A literal world would be a fifth
 * mirror of the engine that nothing checks, and it could express states the
 * reducer cannot reach — a `ready` slot with no backfill behind it, a
 * checkpoint over an empty queue. Replaying actions also produces the right
 * event log for free, and the log is the receipt that the state was earned.
 *
 * Two further rules, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **Park before the payoff.** A scenario that runs to the end is a video of
 *    the playground. The visitor's first click is the interesting one.
 * 2. **Fold your own ticks.** `clock/tick` is dispatched from the script, never
 *    awaited from the ticker — which is disabled under reduced motion, so a
 *    scenario that advanced by letting the clock run would be dead for exactly
 *    the visitors most in need of being handed a parked world.

 * after the fact, and `contactModel()` starts cold (no field promoted yet) so
 * the reservation genuinely waits on the Watcher rather than reusing another
 * field's index headroom, which `warm-path` above demonstrates is the
