/**
 * The Chronicler — multi-worker export drain.
 *
 * **This tick is a no-op, and that is the honest state rather than a stub.**
 *
 * The Chronicler write-probes the artifact disk before claiming a job (ADR
 * 0051), claims rows from `stardust_export_jobs`, paginates `entry_data` with
 * a cursor, streams a CSV or JSON artifact straight to disk without ever
 * buffering it, and — since ADR 0050 — can cooperatively yield a job back to
 * `pending` at a committed chunk boundary rather than running past a time
 * budget. There is nothing here for it to claim, because nothing in the
 * playground submits an export yet — that is the operations section,
 * alongside bulk import, the dead-letter replay and compaction. A real
 * Chronicler with an empty job table does exactly this: claims nothing,
 * writes nothing, and emits nothing.
 *
 * So the card is wired like the other three — its poll period is real, its
 * pause toggle works, and it is genuinely being asked to run on schedule. What
 * it reports is that there is no work, which is true. Faking a progress bar
 * against an export nobody submitted would be the one thing the fidelity rules
 * forbid outright: a beautiful panel teaching something untrue.
 *
 * When the operations section lands, this file grows a claim, a disk probe, a
 * page loop, an artifact writer and the yield check, and nothing about the
 * clock or the card has to change.
