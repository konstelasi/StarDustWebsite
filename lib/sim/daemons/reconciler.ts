/**
 * The Reconciler — multi-worker drain.
 *
 * There is no PID guard and no leader election. `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP
 * LOCKED` is the *only* coordination primitive, and horizontal scale is
 * literally "run more processes". Three of them run here, and the thing worth
 * watching is that they claim disjoint work without ever knowing about each
 * other: worker two does not wait for worker one, it steps over the rows worker
 * one is holding and takes the next ones.
 *
 * ## Work sources are ordered by the engine's list, not by ours
 *
 * The engine round-robins six sources in a fixed order, and that order is
 * observable in an event stream, so its rule is **new sources append, never
 * insert**. What this file mirrors is that *list*, of which it implements five —
 * so what matters here is the **index**, not the end. `sync_queue` is source 1,
 * then `retype_backfill` 3, `rename_backfill` 4, `delete_purge` 5 and
 * `model_delete_purge` 6. The import-job drain is source **2** and belongs to
 * the operations section; when it lands it goes *between* the first two, not
 * on the end.
 *
 * **The model purge is last on purpose**, and not merely by arrival order: it
 * and the sync-queue drain both touch `stardust_sync_queue`, and the engine
 * puts the destructive one behind the one that keeps writes available.
 *
 * ## Two failure states, and only one of them is here
 *
 * `CAPACITY_WAIT` — a source needs a slot that does not exist — short-circuits
 * the rest of the worker's tick, because the contention is on shared state and
 * marching on would spend the other sources' budgets against the same wall.
 *
 * `LOCK_WAIT` is the engine's other one, and it is deliberately absent: see
 * {@link ./types.ts}. Nothing in a browser contends for a *row* — the
 * Liberator's page-level exclusion, simulated since ADR 0049, is a different
 * mechanism at a different granularity and does not bear on this one.

/**
 * Move one bounded chunk of `entry_data.fields` from a field's pre-rename key
 * to its current one.
 *
 * **No slot is touched, so this source has no `capacity_wait`.** A rename can
 * never be blocked on inventory; the only outcomes are work done and idle. That
 * is the one structural difference from source 3, and it is why the deferred
 * reservation that opens `tickRetypeBackfill()` has no counterpart here.
 *
 * ## The rewrite is one statement, not decode-mutate-encode
 *
 * The engine issues `JSON_REMOVE(JSON_SET(…))` per chunk rather than decoding
 * each payload in PHP, because `json_decode($json, true)` is not round-trip
 * faithful: a payload whose keys form a complete sequential list from zero
 * re-encodes as a JSON **array**, so `{"0":"x","1":"y"}` silently becomes
 * `["x","y"]`. Field names are `VARCHAR(128)` with no numeric restriction, so
 * `"0"` is a legal name and that payload is reachable. JavaScript objects have
 * no such collapse, so the hazard does not port — but the **two path guards**
 * that statement carries do, and they are behaviour rather than encoding.

/**
 * Delete one bounded chunk of a severed model's entries — **rows, not keys**.
 *
 * The only drain in the engine that destroys data, and three things about it
 * diverge from its five siblings:
 *
 *   1. **`stardust_sync_queue` rows die in the same chunk transaction.**
 *      Otherwise the sync-queue drain finds no `entry_data` row for each
 *      survivor and files a `missing_entry_data` dead letter — the purge
 *      manufacturing DLQ noise in proportion to pending writes.
 *   2. **The final chunk probes rather than assumes.** `chunk.length <
 *      chunkSize` is a hypothesis; a write transaction that opened before
 *      severance committed carries a pre-severance snapshot for its whole life
 *      and can commit rows afterwards. `entry_data.id` is auto-increment, so
 *      those land ahead of the cursor and are normally caught — unless they
 *      commit after what we thought was the last chunk. One probe turns a
 *      silent permanent orphan into an extra tick.
 *   3. **It re-asserts severance rather than trusting it**, with no status
 *      predicate on the slot sweep: a `tombstoned` row that still holds a
 *      `field_id` re-breaks the cascade, because the foreign key cares about
 *      the column and not the status. If ADR 0037's final chunk is wrong one
 *      row survives; if this one is wrong it fails *after* every earlier chunk
 *      has already committed its deletes, and there is **no DLQ path by
 *      design** — quarantining would leave the exact orphan this eliminates.
