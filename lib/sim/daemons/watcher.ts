/**
 * The Watcher — singleton page provisioner.
 *
 * It does one thing and pointedly does not do the obvious second thing: it adds
 * capacity, and it never claims any. A page appears with every one of its slots
 * free and the field that caused it still unmapped when the tick ends. That gap is
 * not an oversight to be tidied away — it is the separation the whole daemon
 * section exists to show, and collapsing it would turn four independent
 * processes into one pipeline with steps.
 *
 * Everything it decides comes from `capacity.ts`, which is pure and holds the
 * whole policy matrix. This file is the schedule and the logging.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * The engine's Watcher also drives two 24-hour advisory samplers — a
 * cardinality scan and a slot-spread scan — sharing one due time read from the
 * persisted `stardust_advisory_schedule` singleton (ADR 0052), not a
 * per-process jittered field: the schedule is fleet-wide, one sample per
 * interval across the whole deployment, claimed by a conditional UPDATE whose
 * affected-row count is the claim itself. `next_sample_at IS NULL` means
 * "never scheduled", and is what preserves first-sample phase randomisation —
 * the first daemon anywhere to observe it picks a random moment inside the
 * interval. Neither sampler is simulated. A daily cadence has nothing to show
 * on a clock whose ticks are a second apart, and firing them on some invented
 * shorter period would put a number on screen that means nothing. They are
 * advisories: purely observational, never blocking, never remediating, so
 * leaving them out changes no behaviour anywhere else. `lib/sim/ddl.ts`
 * mirrors `stardust_advisory_schedule` regardless, since Section B's
 * DDL-matches-the-engine claim covers every bootstrapped table whether or not
 * this file drives it.
