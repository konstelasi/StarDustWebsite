/**
 * The Liberator — multi-worker slot reclamation.
 *
 * A demoted field leaves its column full of values nobody will ever read again,
 * and the slot marked `tombstoned` so nothing reserves it. The Liberator is what
 * closes that loop: it nullifies the residue chunk by chunk, then hands the slot
 * back as `free`. Without it every demotion would cost a column permanently, the
 * Watcher would keep provisioning pages to replace capacity that was never
 * actually gone, and the two daemons would never once refer to each other — the
 * whole exchange happens through one row's `status`.
 *
 * **It has no PID guard.** ADR 0049 replaced the old process singleton with
 * page-table-granularity `GET_LOCK` exclusion, taken inside the sweep itself —
 * several Liberator processes can run at once, each excluded only from the one
 * `entry_slots_page_N` another is already sweeping. One instance runs here
 * because a single-threaded browser simulation has no second process to
 * contend with; the lock is invisible for the same reason `LOCK_WAIT` is
 * invisible in {@link ./reconciler.ts} — nothing here ever contends for
 * anything.
 *
 * Four details are worth keeping straight:
 *
 *   - **The sweep never joins the field table.** It keys on the page, the
 *     column and a cursor, and nothing else. That is what lets it reclaim a
 *     slot whose field row has already been deleted.
 *   - **`sweepGapCount` survives the reclaim.** It counts chunks a sweep
 *     skipped over under contention, and it is an operator annotation about the
 *     *column*, not about the field that used to hold it. Resetting it on
 *     reclaim would erase the record; the engine clears it at the next
 *     tombstone instead (ADR 0045), which `reserve.ts` mirrors.
 *   - **There is no gap path here, and its absence is why this reclaim is
 *     unconditional.** Contention has no meaning in a single-threaded browser
 *     simulation, so every sweep completes cleanly and every completed sweep
 *     reclaims. In the engine those are two statements: a sweep that abandons a
 *     chunk rewinds and stays tombstoned rather than reclaiming (ADR 0046), so
 *     `free` still means verified empty. Do not read this function as evidence
 *     that reaching the final chunk is sufficient to reclaim.
 *   - **An idle tick emits nothing at all.** Not a heartbeat, not a
 *     `poll_complete`. A daemon with no work is silent, which is why its card
 *     has to read as deliberately quiet rather than broken.
